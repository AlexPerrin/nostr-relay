### [Nostr - Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr)

*"The simplest open protocol that is able to create a censorship-resistant global "social" network once and for all."*[^1]

*"Relays can be hosted by anyone and have any rule or internal policy they want. The fact that the protocol is open makes it so that, as long as there is any relay willing to host someone, they can still publish their stuff for their followers, and the followers can find their stuff in that relay."*[^1]
